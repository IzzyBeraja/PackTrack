## How PackTrack can help you

In todays day in age, we are relying more and more on deliveries to help us get
what we need. There are several places that we rely on for packages ranging from
Amazon to Walmart and other suppliers too. Once you start to realize how many
places packages come from, it's easy to see why having somewhere to check
everything becomes important.

Running a business? Keeping track of when deliveries are going to arrive from
various different delivery companies and marketplaces becomes important.

## How to get started

Easy! Just register on the site and authorize one of the various delivery
services we are compatible with and you're set! Any updates will be tracked on
here from now on.
